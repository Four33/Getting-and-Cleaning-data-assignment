# Download the dataset
1.Dataset downloaded and extracted under the folder called UCI HAR Dataset

File with R code "run_analysis.R" performs the 5 following steps.

Reading in the files and merging the training and the test sets to create one data set.
1. Reading files
Reading training tables
Reading testing tables
Reading feature vector
Reading activity labels
Assigning variable names

2. Extracting only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement.
Reading variable names
Create vector for defining ID, mean and standard deviation
Making subset from merged data set
Using descriptive activity names to name activities
Appropriately labeling the data set with descriptive variable names

3. Creating a second tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
Making tidy data set
Writing tidy data set in txt file

4. Merges the training and test set to create one dataset.
X (10299 rows, 561 columns) is created by merging x_train and x_test using rbind() function
Y (10299 rows, 1 column) is created by merging y_train and y_test using rbind() function
